Notes:
- UFile shows this screen once dividends exist, even if you are paying non-eligible dividends only.
- If you do not designate eligible dividends, the practical expectation is that GRIP is $0 / not needed (but UFile may still require $0 in the “end of previous year” box).
- If you do designate eligible dividends, you must complete this screen consistently with the eligible portion declared on the Dividends paid screen.
