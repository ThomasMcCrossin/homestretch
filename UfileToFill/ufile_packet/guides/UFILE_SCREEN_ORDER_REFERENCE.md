# UFile Screen Order Reference (FY2024/FY2025)

Purpose: keep the per-year fill guide section order aligned with the UFile left-hand “Contents” tree so the operator can work top-to-bottom without hunting.

Screenshots captured from UFile (cutoff is **Corporate history**, which appears at the bottom):
