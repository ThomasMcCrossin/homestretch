## Commentary (management explanation)
- Management expected the Amherst Ramblers to have a longer playoff run and purchased additional inventory to meet expected demand.
- The team was knocked out in round 1, resulting in higher ending inventory than would be typical for the season.
- Management believes the recorded inventory balance may be conservative; no adjustment has been made without additional support.
- FY2025 inventory support is based on a physical count performed near year-end (May 16, 2025) plus management adjustments for immaterial movements through May 31, 2025.
