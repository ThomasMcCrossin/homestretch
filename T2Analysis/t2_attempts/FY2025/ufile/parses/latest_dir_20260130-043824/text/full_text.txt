BAR CODE RETURN (BCR) VALIDITY CHECKS FAILED
No bar codes were generated
These tax calculations failed the validity checks for bar codes. Therefore, no bar codes were
generated and you will not be able to file this return with the CRA.
BCR validity checks relate mainly to incomplete or inconsistent data entry. Review the
error and warning messages shown below and in the data editor, then make the required
changes and recalculate.
The CRA imposes certain validity checks on approved software to ensure that it can
process BCR's accurately and quickly. Tax returns containing BCR's that fail these checks
are re-routed by the CRA to a manual assessment process which results in potential delays
of several months and increased communication between the CRA and the taxpayer.
NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODES
The integration of NAICS codes requires corporations to pick their main revenue-generating business
activity. Active corporations that file their T2 returns either by Internet or on paper using 2D bar codes
must choose the most appropriate code to describe their main revenue-generating business activity.
It is crucial that the most accurate business activity is selected the first time (using the keyword
NAICS.ACT in the ACTIVITY keyword group), since the first year's code is carried forward to
subsequent years, allowing for a simple validation of the description when no change in the
main business activity occurs.
Therefore, for subsequent years, the corporation should validate that the business description
chosen for the last return filed is still accurate. If the last business description is still accurate,
no further action will be required. The return may be transmitted electronically or printed in bar-
code format.
If the last business description is not accurate, the corporation must select an updated business
activity description.
Should you have any questions to describe your active corporation's main revenue-generating business
activity when filing your T2 return, please call the CRA Business Enquiries line at 1-800-959-5525.

Bar Code Return (BCR) validity checks failed
No bar codes were generated
Tax return cannot be filed with CRA
These tax calculations failed the validity checks for bar codes. Therefore, no bar codes were generated and you
will not be able to file this return with the CRA.
The CRA imposes certain validity checks on approved software to ensure that it can process BCR's accurately
and quickly. Tax returns containing BCR's that fail these checks are re-routed by the CRA to a manual assessment
process which results in potential delays of several months and increased communication between the CRA and
the taxpayer.
BCR validity checks relate mainly to incomplete or inconsistent data entry. Review the error and warning messages
shown on the diagnostics report and in the data editor, then make the required changes and recalculate.
Forcing the generation of the Bar Code Return
In a situation where you are unable to resolve all the problems encountered, you may use the keyword BCR-OV
to force the generation of the Bar Code Return.
Note however that this alternative should only be used in rare and exceptional cases.
A tax return that fails the DT Max validity checks will also fail the CRA checks, and will therefore be delayed
and re-routed to the manual assessment process.
