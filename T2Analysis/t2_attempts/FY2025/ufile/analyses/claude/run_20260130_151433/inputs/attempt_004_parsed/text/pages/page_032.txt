2 If the connected payer corporation's tax year ends after the corporation's balance-due day for the tax year (two or three months, as applicable), you have
to estimate the payer's dividend refund when you calculate the corporation's Part IV tax payable.
3 For eligible dividends received from connected corporations, Part IV tax on dividends is equal to column I divided by column H multiplied by column G.
4 For taxable dividends received from connected corporations, Part IV tax on dividends is equal to column I divided by column H multiplied by column F.
5 For the purpose of calculating your eligible refundable dividend tax on hand (ERDTOH), Part IV tax on taxable dividends received from connected
corporations (with a tax year starting after 2018) is equal to the sum of Part IV tax on eligible dividends and non-eligible dividends received from
connected corporations to the extent that such dividends caused a dividend refund to those corporations from their ERDTOH.
Part IV tax before deductions on taxable dividends received from connected corporations for purposes of column L is the sum of (i) and (ii), where
(i) Part IV tax on eligible dividends received from connected corporations is equal to amount CC of the connected payer corporation (on page 7
of the T2 return) divided by line 465 of the connected payer corporation, multiplied by column G; and
(ii)Part IV tax on non-eligible dividends received from connected corporations is equal to amount II of the connected payer corporation
(on page 7 of the T2 return) divided by line 470 of the connected payer corporation, multiplied by the difference between columns F and G.
