# Packaging / containers root-cause track (FY2024 + FY2025)

This section is about whether packaging should be expensed immediately (supplies) or timed through inventory/COGS.
We are not setting policy here; we are documenting evidence and what would need to be true for a change to be required.

## FY2024
- Packaging-related TB total (net): `4,665.67`

| account_code | account_name | gifi_code | t2125_line | net_dollars |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 5200 | Packaging & Supplies | 9130 | 8810 | 4,118.38 |
| 5202 | Packaging - Bags/Wrapping | 9130 | 8810 | 3.62 |
| 9000 | Deposits - Bottle/Container | 8518 | 8518 | 543.67 |

- Project year-end inventory (Schedule 100 GIFI 1121): `2,847`

## FY2025
- Packaging-related TB total (net): `3,622.39`

| account_code | account_name | gifi_code | t2125_line | net_dollars |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 5200 | Packaging & Supplies | 9130 | 8810 | 2,675.10 |
| 9000 | Deposits - Bottle/Container | 8518 | 8518 | 947.29 |

- Project year-end inventory (Schedule 100 GIFI 1121): `10,015`

## Evidence-based interpretation
- Packaging is currently mapped to **GIFI 9130 (Supplies)** and expensed when purchased.
- Inventory (1121) appears to represent food/beverage inventory only; packaging is not obviously included in the inventory accounts.

## What would make this a required change (audit/risk)
- If you routinely have a material amount of packaging on hand at year-end and want matching timing, you would need to include packaging in the year-end count and move those purchases through inventory/COGS.
- If packaging on hand is immaterial, expensing to supplies is typically the boring/defensible approach.

## Proposed next check (low effort)
- Confirm whether the physical year-end inventory count includes packaging/containers. If it does, we should treat packaging as part of inventory/COGS timing; if it does not, the current treatment is consistent.
