Assembling the federal T2 tax return when paper filing
Agency
When filing a tax return, the attachments should be arranged in the order in which they are processed by the department (see the
appropriate order in the list below). This will accelerate processing of the returns. Also, if you are making an election, note it
prominently in the relevant area of the return and schedules, or attach a note.
Order of attachments (as per IC97-2):
T2 Bar Code Return with the pages in the order DT Max prints it (this includes the GIFI component of the T2 return)
Please note that for tax years ending after December 31, 2008, corporations are no longer required to file federal T2 RSI's
(Return and Schedule Information) when filing returns in paper form, as they are obsolete.
Other attachments
This includes forms, eligibility certificates and other certificates or attestations which are not captured within the Bar Code Return.
If you have an election that applies to the return that is being filed:
If the election has a prescribed form, such as Form T2054, Election for a Capital Dividend under Subsection 83(2),
complete a paper copy and file it separately.
If the election does not have a prescribed form, send your notes on a separate piece of paper with the T2 Bar Code
Return.
Slips, receipts, and documents
Although all slips and receipts do not have to be sent to CRA, keep all corporation information slips, receipts, and papers
for at least 6 years. CRA may ask to see them at a later date.
