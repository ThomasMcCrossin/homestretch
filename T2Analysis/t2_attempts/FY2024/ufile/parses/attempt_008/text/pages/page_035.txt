Note 3: If a class number has not been provided in Schedule II of the Income Tax Regulations for a particular class of property, use the subsection provided in Regulation 1101.
Note 4: Include any property acquired in previous years that has now become available for use, net of any government assistance received or entitled to be received in the year from a government,
municipality or other public authority, or a reduction of capital cost after the application of section 80. This property would have been previously excluded from column 3. List separately any
acquisitions of property in the class that are not subject to the 50% rule. See Income Tax Folio S3-F4-C1, General Discussion of Capital Cost Allowance, for exceptions to the 50% rule. Do not
include any amount in column 3 in respect of property included in column 5 (see note 6). See Guide T4012 for more information about the cost of acquisitions during the year.
Note 5: A DIEP reported in column 4 is a property acquired after April 18, 2021, by a corporation that was a Canadian-controlled private corporation (CCPC) throughout the year, which became available
for use in the tax year (before 2024) and was designated as such on or before the day that is 12 months after the filing-due date for the tax year to which the designation relates. It includes all
capital property subject to the CCA rules, if certain conditions are met, other than property included in Classes 1 to 6, 14.1, 17, 47, 49, and 51. A property can only qualify as DIEP in the year in
which it becomes available for use. See subsection 1104(3.1) of the Regulations for more information.
Note 6: Enter in column 5, "Adjustments and transfers," amounts that increase or reduce the UCC (column 10). Items that increase the UCC include amounts transferred under section 85, or transferred
on amalgamation or winding-up of a subsidiary. Items that reduce the UCC (show amounts that reduce the UCC in brackets) include assistance received or receivable during the year for a
property, subsequent to its disposition, if such assistance would have decreased the capital cost of the property by virtue of paragraph 13(7.1)(f). See Guide T4012 for other examples of
adjustments and transfers to include in column 5.
Also include property acquired in a non-arm's length transaction [other than by virtue of a right referred to in paragraph 251(5)(b)] if the property was a depreciable property acquired by the
transferor at least 364 days before the end of your tax year and continuously owned by the transferor until it was acquired by you.
Note 7: Include all amounts of assistance you received (or were entitled to receive) after the disposition of a depreciable property that would have decreased the capital cost of the property by virtue of
paragraph 13(7.1)(f) if received before the disposition.
