Bar Code Return (BCR) validity checks failed
No bar codes were generated
Tax return cannot be filed with CRA
These tax calculations failed the validity checks for bar codes. Therefore, no bar codes were generated and you
will not be able to file this return with the CRA.
The CRA imposes certain validity checks on approved software to ensure that it can process BCR's accurately
and quickly. Tax returns containing BCR's that fail these checks are re-routed by the CRA to a manual assessment
process which results in potential delays of several months and increased communication between the CRA and
the taxpayer.
BCR validity checks relate mainly to incomplete or inconsistent data entry. Review the error and warning messages
shown on the diagnostics report and in the data editor, then make the required changes and recalculate.
Forcing the generation of the Bar Code Return
In a situation where you are unable to resolve all the problems encountered, you may use the keyword BCR-OV
to force the generation of the Bar Code Return.
Note however that this alternative should only be used in rare and exceptional cases.
A tax return that fails the DT Max validity checks will also fail the CRA checks, and will therefore be delayed
and re-routed to the manual assessment process.
