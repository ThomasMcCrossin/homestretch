# Diffs

Purpose: keep human-readable “what changed” reports when we make targeted accounting or mapping changes (e.g., vendor split logic) so filing work in UFile is easy to update without guesswork.

- Each diff doc should name the **baseline snapshot** and the **post-change snapshot** (or DB snapshot paths).
- Prefer listing deltas by fiscal year and by the specific UFile/GIFI lines the user actually fills.
