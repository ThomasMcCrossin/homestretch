# Prompts

Store prompts here so we can:
- see exactly what was asked on each exploration run
- compare Claude vs Codex output apples-to-apples
- iterate safely without rewriting or losing context

## Active prompts

- Claude: `T2Analysis/prompts/claude/PROMPT_CLAUDE_UFILE_FY2025_ATTEMPT_DIAGNOSIS_v2.md`
- Codex: `T2Analysis/prompts/codex/PROMPT_CODEX_UFILE_FY2025_ATTEMPT_DIAGNOSIS_v2.md`

## Legacy prompts

Older variants (including “extract text from PDF” versions) live under `T2Analysis/prompts/legacy/` and should not be used for new runs.
