 Errors that prevent filing
A tax return was generated. However, the errors below prevent the transmission of your declaration.

 


BAR CODE RETURN (BCR) VALIDITY CHECKS FAILED
No bar codes were generated

These tax calculations failed the validity check for bar codes. Therefore, no bar codes were generated and you will not be able to file this return with the CRA.
BCR validity checks relate mainly to incomplete or inconsistent data entry. Review the error and warning messages, then make the required changes and recalculate.
The CRA imposes certain validity checks on approved software to ensure that it can process BCR's accurately and quickly. Tax returns containing BCR's that fail these checks are re-routed by the CRA to a manual assessment process which results in potential delays of several months and increased communication between the CRA and the taxpayer.
 
 You cannot currently EFILE your federal return. Please review the following reasons, and make corrections when possible.

 


The federal BCR is not being generated.
