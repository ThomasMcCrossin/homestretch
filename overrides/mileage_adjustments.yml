# Mileage adjustments are explicit, FY-scoped overlays.
#
# Why this exists:
# - The base shareholder mileage logs are reconstructed working papers.
# - FY2024 had a post-hoc “Dartmouth/Halifax-area Costco trips” adjustment added on top of the initial estimate.
# - We want that adjustment to be deterministic, documented, and FY-scoped (do NOT leak into FY2025+).
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - These adjustments are working-paper support and should NOT be pasted into “Notes to FS”.
# - Keep the rationale/evidence in repo docs/outputs; the financial statement notes should remain high-level.
#
# Structure:
#   adjustments:
#     FY2024:
#       thomas_additional_mileage_claim_cents: 51527   # adds $515.27 to Thomas FY2024 mileage claim
#       note: "..."
#
adjustments:
  FY2024:
    thomas_additional_mileage_claim_cents: 51527
    note: "Post-hoc Dartmouth/Halifax-area mileage add-on (kept for FY2024; FY2024 reimbursement already settled)."

  FY2025:
    thomas_additional_mileage_claim_cents: 0
    note: "No Dartmouth/Halifax add-on for FY2025."
