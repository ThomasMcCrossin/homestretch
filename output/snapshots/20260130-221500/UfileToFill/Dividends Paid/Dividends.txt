FY2025 example for this project (whole dollars)
- Taxable dividend paid: $36,900 (matches GIFI 3700 “Dividends declared”).
- Eligible portion: $0 (unless you explicitly decide to designate eligible dividends in UFile).

Notes
- UFile presents the dividend types as separate expandable (“+”) panels.
- If dividends are declared (GIFI 3700) but the “Dividends paid” screen is left incomplete, UFile can raise validation messages and/or retained earnings inconsistencies.
