# UFile T2 Fill Guide (Deprecated Combined View)

This combined guide previously attempted to list **FY2024 + FY2025** in one file, but it is easy for it to drift out of sync.

Use the **FY-specific** guides instead (they are regenerated from `packet.json` and validated):

- FY2024: `UfileToFill/ufile_packet/years/FY2024/UFILet2_FILL_GUIDE.md`
- FY2025: `UfileToFill/ufile_packet/years/FY2025/UFILet2_FILL_GUIDE.md`
