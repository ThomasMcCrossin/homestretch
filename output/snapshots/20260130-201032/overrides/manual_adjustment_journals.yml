# Manual adjustment journals
#
# Purpose:
# - Capture true accrual/cutoff adjustments as deterministic, repeatable journals
#   without editing any imported “facts”.
# - These are posted into `journal_entries`/`journal_entry_lines` in `db/t2_final.db`.
#
# Conventions:
# - Amounts are dollars as strings; script converts to cents.
# - Debits/credits must balance per journal.
# - entry_date is ISO (YYYY-MM-DD) and drives FY inclusion.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - Prefer net-only accruals for multi-period Wave bills; HST/ITC timing is handled
#   separately by invoice-date-based tax recognition in Wave bill allocations.

  # Jesse payroll-related adjustments paid outside the payroll export
  #
  # In January 2024, Jesse received separate e-transfers that were not represented as net-pay rows
  # in the per-employee payroll export. Per operator recollection, these represent:
  # - Online tips paid out directly, and
  # - A CPP reimbursement (Jesse was under 18; CPP was deducted in error in some periods).
  #
  # Accounting intent:
  # - Ensure the bank debits categorized as payroll clear a corresponding payable (2000) instead of
  #   distorting accounts payable due to “missing accrual”.
  # - We treat the full amount as wages/tips expense for conservatism and simplicity (immaterial dollars).

  # Credit-card payment gap (Dwayne)
  #
  # We run Dwayne’s business purchases through his personal credit cards, and the corp pays the cards from the bank.
  # When a Wave bill is CC-paid, we post an AP→2410 (Due to Dwayne) settlement credit. When the bank pays the card,
  # we debit 2410. If the bank payments exceed the CC-settlement credits, then (assuming no personal reimbursements)
  # the difference is effectively a *credit balance / prepayment* sitting on the card at year-end that will be applied
  # against future business charges (e.g., the documented Bell “prepay through Nov” behavior).
  #
  # We model that as a year-end prepaid asset so that `2410` reflects the intended “only mileage + meals remains owed”
  # at each FY end, without rewriting any bank facts.
